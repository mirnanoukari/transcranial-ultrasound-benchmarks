## Overview

This repository provides the MATLAB functions and scripts used for comparing model results for the benchmarks outlined [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04552).

## Quick start guide

1. Download the intercomparison data files from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6020543) and unzip.
2. Clone or download this code repository.
3. Open MATLAB, and navigate to the code repository folder.
4. Run `processAll` to generate the paper figures and supplementary materials (this may take some time, particularly to run `computeAllMetrics`).
5. Run `compareTwo` to compare two models for a specified benchmark and source. For example, to compare `KWAVE` and `STRIDE` for benchmark 7 for the bowl source, run:

```matlab
metrics = compareTwo('KWAVE', 'STRIDE', 7, 1, 'C:\DATA', true);
```

## Using the skull models

This repository also hosts the `.stl` files for the skull models used for benchmarks 7 to 9, along with the affine transforms to position the transducer in the coordinate system of the `.stl` file. To rasterize the `.stl` files to a regular Cartesian mesh with a paricular grid resolution, use `rasterizeSkullMeshes`. This function requires the [iso2mesh toolbox](http://iso2mesh.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi). Note, for higher-resolution grids, this function requires significant computer memory. Pre-computed meshes are available in the `SKULL-MAPS` folder in the data repository stored in Zenodo (see above). Note, the rasterized meshes already incorporate the affine transforms to move the skull relative to the transducer. 

## Adding new model results

To add new model results:
1. Decide on a name for the model, e.g., `NEWMODEL` and add this to the list `intercomparison/getModelNames`.
1. Create a `NEWMODEL` folder in the downloaded results (see above). Add the model results to this folder following the naming convention, e.g., `PH1-BM1-SC1_NEWMODEL.mat`.
1. To compare results for one benchmark, call `compareTwo` as outlined above. 
1. To re-generate the intercomparison results with the new model, run `processAll`.
